<h1>What is New in Version 8.0</h1>

<p>
    Version 8.0 of <i>GameMaker</i></i> has a large number of improvements over version 7.0.
Below the most important changes are described.


<h3>Incompatibilities</h3>

<p>
Text splash screens can no longer show images. However, web splash screens have been added that can
show full html documents with images, etc.

<p>
A number of changes have been made to the functions related to sprite and background resources. This
is due to the fact that <i>GameMaker</i> uses a completely new mechanism for these resources. If your game
uses a lot of calls to functions that load or save image resources on the fly you are strongly recommended
to keep using the old version 7.0 for that game.

<p>
If you use extension packages you will have to reinstall them.
</p>

<p>
Some changes have been made to the timeline mechanism that can lead to incompatibilities. In particular, assigning a
timeline and starting it are now two separate things.
</p>

<p>
An important bug has been solved in which collision events where executed twice if two
objects have collision events with each other. Some games however might have relied on this bug
and, hence, might no longer function correctly.
</p>

<h3>Notizie</h3>

<p>
<i>GameMaker</i> now default shows a News page when it is started. Here new versions will be announced, 
new resources will be indicated, there
is information about competition, and game design tips and tricks. News is shown only once a day. In the Standard
Edition this can be switched off. You can always access the news through the Help menu and you are encouraged
to regularly check the news for important information about <i>GameMaker</i>.


<h3>Tutorial</h3>

<p>
<i>GameMaker</i> now has a standard built-in tutorial for beginners. It is shown in a panel at the right of the
screen. Experienced users can indicate that they do not want to see the tutorial anymore. To accommodate for the
tutorial panel, <i>GameMaker</i> is now default started in full screen mode. It does however remember its settings
so changing it once to windowed mode will from that moment on start it in that mode.
</p>


<h3>Alpha-blended backgrounds and sprites</h3>

<p>
The new version <i>GameMaker</i> uses backgrounds and sprites with alpha (transparency) channels. This makes it
possible to create and use much nicer sprites. PNG files with such information are now correctly loaded. The sprite
and image editor have been completely rewritten, including many new drawing options and effects. A new
sprite file selector was added that shows the animations in the sprites. Also we bundle
a large number of high-quality sprites with <i>GameMaker</i> that you can use for free in your games.
</p>


<h3>Enhanced collision checking</h3>

<p>
You now have more collision checking options. For example, you can indicate that collisions should be with an
enclosed disk and you have better control over the bounding box. 
The sub-image of the sprite can have a combined
mask and you can set the dependence on the alpha transparency value.
</p>


<h3>Splash screens</h3>

<p>
A new function splash_show_web(url,delay) has been added that can be used to show web pages as splash screens.
You can also use local html pages for this. This allows for a powerful mechanism to e.g. create help pages. A
close button is added to the splash screens. Also a number of new actions have been added to show the
different types of splash pages and to change splash settings. (The old Show Video and Webpage actions have
been removes as the new actions include them. They will though still work in old games.)

<h3>Trigger events</h3>

<p>
A new type of event has been introduced: Trigger events. Trigger events you can specify yourself. You give them
a name and a condition, written in GML. After this they can be used in all objects, just like other events. With
this you can easily extend the functionality of <i>GameMaker</i>.
</p>

<h3>Time lines</h3>

<p>
The timelines have been extended. The property form has additional buttons to e.g. spread out the moments and
to delete or duplicate ranges of moments. Timelines can now be paused and restarted and they can even be played backwards.
Also they can now loop automatically.
</p>

<h3>Importing and exporting resources</h3>

<p>
The possibility to merge games has been replaced by a much more extensive system to import and export resources. 
The user can indicate which resources to export to a file (.gmres). Next they can be imported in a different game. 
In principle only one resource can exist for each name. When there is a name conflict when importing the 
use can specify to keep the original, replace anyway, take the one that is most recently changed, or 
keep both (not recommended). To be able to do the third option, all resources now keep track of when 
they were last changed.
</p>

<h3>Rewritten script and code editor</h3>

<p>
The built-in script/code editor has been completely rewritten, making it a lot easier to write code. 
For example there is pop-up function name completion, argument help, matching brackets, improved color coding, 
line numbers, on-the-fly error checking, code snippets, and a sophisticated find and replace functionality.
</p>

<h3>Speed improvements</h3>

<p>
The speed of games that use code has been considerably improved. A speed-up of up to 100% is 
sometimes possible. Also the loading time for games is often considerably improved. 
Also when running a stand-alone game.
</p>


<h3>Other changes</h3>

<p>
There are a number of other changes and additions. Here are some of the important ones.

<ul>
  <li>You can now use high quality icons for your games.</li>  
  <li> Constants can now be defined in their own form (rather than through the Global Game Settings). 
    As a result they can remain visible while you are e.g. writing scripts. You can also load and
	save the constants to text files. </li>
  <li> Also included files are no longer shown in the Global Game Settings but in their own form.</li>
  <li> Many small visual improvements</li>
  <li> Added function random_range(x1,x2), irandom(x), and irandom_range(x1,x2). The latter do give
    integer results and can include x or x2.</li>
	<li>Added functions mouse_wheel_up and mouse_wheel_down.</li>
	<li>Added a function set_application_title(title) to set the title of the application 
          (which is shown in the taskbar).</li>
	<li>Added function file_text_eoln().</li>
	<li>Added read-only variabe debug_mode.</li>
  <li> There is now a game setting to disallow screensavers or powersaving options (sleep, hybernate) while
    the game is running (default disallowed).</li>
  <li>Added functions disk_size(drive) and disk_free(drive) and a variable gamemaker_version.</li>
  <li>Runtime error messages better indicate the position of the error</li>
  <li>You can now change to location of the temporary files, see the page on Preferences.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Corrected bugs</h3>

<p>
The following bugs were corrected. A number of other smaller bugs were corrected as well.

</ul>
